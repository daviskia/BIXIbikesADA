Do you prefer to cycle between two cars or on a quiet cycle path next to the road?

What if the possibility of riding on a road exclusively dedicated to bicycles influenced your itinary?

That is the question we asked ourselves in this section. Our assumption was that the presence of numerous bicycle paths between two stations would influence the popularity of the trip between these same two stations.

## Our Bike Paths Dataset

The dataset we used comes from the Active Transportation Division of Montreal, it is all the bike paths that have been built or traced in Montreal. These paths consist mainly of bicycle lanes but also include a few on-street paths, sidewalk paths and multi-purpose paths.

In order to evaluate how safe it is to bike in different areas of the city we took a look at the density of bike paths in each area. The 


Maps we have right now:
